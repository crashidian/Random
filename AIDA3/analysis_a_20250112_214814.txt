- the ability to upload and run simulations, initiate new experiments, and extend digital models tailored to uav operations would significantly enhance the development process, saving time and resources while optimizing model performance for different scenarios.
- for developing enhanced simulation environment were different design of feedback mechanisms, reasoning processes, and compliance protocols of the explainable ai can be tested and validated.
- digital twin will be linked to simulation model for operational planning, routing, and real-time control for risk mitigation and cost effective operations
