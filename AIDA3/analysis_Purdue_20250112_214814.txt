Analysis for: How would you like to use Purdue XTM? (e.g. are their specific radar requirements? Is there a need for portable radars? What are particular requirements with respect to low altitude weather network station? Where do you want to place them?)

IDENTIFIED NEEDS AND REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------

Operational Requirements:
- to test and optimize swarm uav operations for disaster impact assessment.
- i won't be using purdue xtm, but the specifications and performance of the communication network will be of interest in development of routing and real-time response.

Software Requirements:
- we need to have simulation or use cases that are both urban and rural?

Infrastructure Requirements:
- i won't be using purdue xtm, but the specifications and performance of the communication network will be of interest in development of routing and real-time response.
